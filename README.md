Welcome to my game project, inspired by titles like Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics! This game features strategic gameplay centered around stealth, tactical movement, and the use of A* pathfinding algorithms.

Overview
In this game, players must eliminate the boss to win while navigating a world filled with challenges. Avoid detection from three different types of guards, each with unique behaviors and strategies:

Guard Type 1: 
- Gets distracted by stones and will chase after them.  
- Communicates with other guards and informs them of the player’s last seen location if spotted.
Guard Type 2: 
- Observes the direction where the stone is thrown but does not move.
- Communicates with other guards and informs them of the player’s last seen location if spotted.
Guard Type 3:
- The only guard type that can see the player through bushes.
- Observes the direction where the stone is thrown but does not move.
- Communicates with other guards and informs them of the player’s last seen location if spotted.

Additionally, be mindful of bystanders. If they spot the player, they will rush to inform the guards, making stealth crucial for success.

Features
A Pathfinding*: The game utilizes A* pathfinding for both player and guard movement, ensuring fluid navigation and realistic guard behaviors.
Stealth Mechanics: Use distractions and the environment to evade detection.
Dynamic Guard Responses: Guards communicate and coordinate, making each encounter unique and challenging.
